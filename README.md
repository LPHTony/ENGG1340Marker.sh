# ENGG1340Tester.sh

A simple shell script for testing the sample test cases of the ENGG1340 assignments.

This script will keep updating according to the future unannounced assignment or anything I would like to try later. (e.g. support of makefile)

## Directory example:
The root directory of the script is based on **Code templates and sample test cases.zip**.

1. Example1/ (Testing only one questions)
   - p1/
     - sample_test_cases/
       - input1_1.txt
       - output1_1.txt
     - 1.cpp
     - ðŸ‘‰**mark.sh**
   - p2/
     - sample_test_cases/
       - ...
     - 2.cpp
     - ðŸ‘‰**mark.sh**
   - p3/
     - ...

2. Example2 (Testing all questions at once)
   - p1/
     - sample_test_cases/
       - ...
     - 1.cpp
   - p2/
     - sample_test_cases/
       - ...
     - 2.cpp
   - ðŸ‘‰**mark.sh**
